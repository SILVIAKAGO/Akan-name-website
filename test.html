              The Akan people of ghana frequently name their children after the day
              of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These
              'day names'have further meaning concerning the soul and character of the
              person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to 
              their birthorder, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.
              This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates
              the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender
              if outputs their Akan Name.
